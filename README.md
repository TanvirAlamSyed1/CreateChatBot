# Build a ChatGPT-Powered PDF Assistant with Langchain and Streamlit

## How to Run the application
- Firstly you must have python downloaded, hers is the link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Then run the requirement file via the following line of code : pip install -r requirement.txt 
- once downloaded, run the following command in the terminal: streamlit run app.py


## Description of the Code
This code was a side project I was looking into as I was egar to look into AI capabilities. Watching this video, I created an up-to-date version of his running code. Now that I have the base working, I will try and make it into a fully functional website :)
You simply import a pdf file into the website and it will create a chat calledbot that you can interact with!

## What I learnt

- Python libraries langchain and streamlit
- how to use openai api keys to utilise LLM
- using git in a sensible manner

## Disclaimer
- When generating an api key, make sure you put money into your openapi account (I know, it sounds like a scam, but it isn't), i put roughly Â£10, which is more than enough, and you can make sure it doesn't incure any more bills by turning off the auto recharge!
