## Description of the Code
This code was a side project I was looking into as I was egar to look into AI capabilities.
You simply import a pdf file into the website and it will create a chat calledbot that you can interact with!

## What I learnt

- Python libraries langchain and streamlit
- how to use openai api keys to utilise LLM

## Disclaimer
- When generating an api key, make sure you put money into your openapi account (I know, it sounds like a scam, but it isn't), i put roughly £10, which is more than enough, and you can make sure it doesn't incure any more bills by turning off the auto recharge!
